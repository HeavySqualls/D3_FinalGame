  tutorialInfo: "Punch Crabworm larvae when they jump at you to kill them instantly!
    \n\nIf you get hit, your character starts flashing slowly. More damage increases
    the flashing speed and eventually kills your character! You are far from invincible!\n\n\"Embrace
    the winds and move with the spirits. Remember the tapestry of consequences that
    trails away from every action.\"\n- Sixth Talmae of the Tribes"
