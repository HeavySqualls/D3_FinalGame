  tutorialInfo: "If he dies, your character will respawn near the last activated
    checkpoint. You won't lose collected Scrap or Artifacts but unbeaten challenges
    will have to be tackled again!\n\n\"D\xE9j\xE0-vu has been explained in many
    ways but here's the plain truth: our universe holds an infinite number of iterations
    -or dimensions- and d\xE9j\xE0-vu happens when a new iteration comes into existence,
    just outside our time and space. I know. I've been there.\"\n- Amadeus Shnapenson
